# Time Warp<br>Virtual Time for the JVM

This library lets you create virtual-time clocks and install them as the JVM's clock to help with testing.

A virtual-time `Clock` will modify the operation of
`System.currentTimeMillis()`, `System.nanoTime()`, `Thread.sleep`, `Object.wait(long)`, `LockSupport.parkNanos` 
and any other operation relying on timeouts.

Use this library to slow-down/speed-up/manually control the JVM's clock to make your
timing-sensitive tests less flaky.

## Status

Early days. 
We've begun using TimeWarp's `ScaledClock` (and `SystemClock`) in [Quasar](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar) tests.
`ManualClock` hasn't been tested, so it probably doesn't work yet.

## Usage

1. Clone and build the repository with `./gradlew` or use Maven artifact `co.paralleluniverse:timewarp:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`
from the Sonatype snapshot repository (`https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots`)

2. Add the JAR file to your bootstrap classpath with `-Xbootclasspath/a:[timewarp jar]` and as an agent
with `-javaagent:[timewarp jar]`

3. Install one of the provided clocks, `SystemClock`, `ScaledClock`, or `ManualClock`, using the `VirtualClock` class. 
Please consult the [Javadocs](http://docs.paralleluniverse.co/timewarp/javadoc/) for detailed information.
Alternatively, you can pass an integer as a command-line argument to the agent (e.g. `-javaagent:[timewarp jar]=3`),
which would install a global scaling clock, that would slow down the system clock by a factor equal to the parameter.
So an argument of 3 would install a `ScaledClock` with a scaling factor of `0.33333`.
